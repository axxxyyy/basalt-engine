/** An entry in a generational index vector implementation.
  *
  * ==Background==
  *
  * An generational indices-based data structure used for uniquely identifying
  * entities. Inlined/opaque type aliased to an [[Int]]eger as a
  * bit-packed/encoded data-structure divided into two parts:
  *   - the first 32 bits are used for the index
  *   - the last 32 bits are used for the generation
  *
  * ===Motivation===
  *
  * The motivation for this data structure is to have a way to uniquely identify
  * entities even when recycling their indexes. Each time an entity is deleted,
  * the generation count goes up by one. This way, the index can be recycled
  * without the risk of having invalid references to the previous entity with
  * the same index.
