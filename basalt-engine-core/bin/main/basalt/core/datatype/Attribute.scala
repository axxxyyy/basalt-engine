/** An [[Attribute]] is a special type of built-in [[Component]] given by the
  * platform implementation. [[Attribute]]s are used to store data that is
  * already provided by the platform, such as hunger, health, display name, etc.
  *
  * [[Attribute]]s are not serialized and deserialized by default, unless
  * specified otherwise. Components on the other hand, are the opposite.
  *
  * Marker [[Attribute]]s (attributes without any data) are used for signaling
  * or identification purposes.
  *
  * ==Example==
  *
  * {{{
  *  case object Hunger extends Attribute[Int]
  *
  *  case object Player extends Attribute[Nothing]
  *
  *  case object Health extends Attribute[Int]
  * }}}
